  // trying to assign one here.  However, most MPMs seem to do it in a similar
  // way: for non-threaded MPMs (e.g. Prefork, WinNT), the ID is just the
  // child ID, which is a small nonnegative integer (i.e. an array index into
  // the list of active child processes); for threaded MPMs (e.g. Worker,
  // Event) the ID is typically ((child_index * thread_limit) + thread_index),
  // which will again be a positive integer, most likely (but not necessarily,
  // if thread_limit is set absurdly high) smallish.
  //
  // Therefore, the approach that we take is to concatenate the Apache
  // connection ID for the master connection with a small integer from IDPool
  // that's unique within the process, and, to avoid conflicts with
  // MPM-assigned connection IDs, we make our slave connection ID negative.
  // We only have so many bits to work with
  // (especially if long is only four bytes instead of eight), so we could
  // potentially run into trouble if the master connection ID gets very large
  // or we have too many active tasks simultaneously (i.e. more than 2^16).
  // So, this approach definitely isn't any kind of robust; but it will
  // probably usually work. It would, of course, be great to replace this
  // with a better strategy, if we find one.
